- `speech_recognition` (for voice recognition)
- `wikipedia` (for fetching Wikipedia data)
- `requests` (for web requests)
- `pyjokes` (for jokes)
- `wolframalpha` (for solving queries)

Install dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition wikipedia pyjokes requests wolframalpha

Running the Assistant

### Explanation of Markdown Syntax:
1. **Headers**: 
   - `#` for H1, `##` for H2, `###` for H3, etc. Use headers to create sections in your README.
   - Example: `## **Overview**` makes a bold, medium-sized header.
   
2. **Bold Text**: 
   - Use `**` around text to make it bold.
   - Example: `**MIT License**` will display "MIT License" in bold.
   
3. **Code Blocks**:
   - For inline code, wrap the code in backticks (`).
     - Example: \`python voice_assistant.py\` displays `python voice_assistant.py`.
   - For multi-line code blocks, use triple backticks (```)
     - Example:
     ```bash
     pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition
     ```

4. **Lists**:
   - Use `-` or `*` for bullet points.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     - Open YouTube
     - Check time
     ```

5. **Links**: 
   - Use `[link text](URL)` to add links.
   - Example: `[GitHub](https://github.com)` will display "GitHub" as a clickable link.

6. **Sections**:
   - You can create sections with headers and add descriptions or usage instructions below them.

### What the Final Markdown `README.md` Looks Like:
- **Titles/headers** are used for the main sections.
- **Bold text** highlights important terms or headings.
- **Code blocks** make commands, snippets, and installation instructions clear.
- **Lists** present easy-to-read, organized information like commands or features.

By using markdown formatting like this, your README will look much more polished and user-f
